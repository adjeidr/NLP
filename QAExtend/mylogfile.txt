'George Washington' (February 22, 1732}}&nbsp;– , 1799) was an American
statesman and soldier who served as the first President of the United States
from 1789 to 1797 and was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He
served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American
Revolutionary War, and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the
United States Constitution. As a driving force behind the nation's establishment
he came to be known as the "father of the country," both during his lifetime and
to this day.

Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family
of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he
inherited. In his youth, he became a senior officer in the colonial militia
during the first stages of the French and Indian War. He gradually grew
indifferent to British rule with its lack of colonial representation in British
Parliament and excessive taxation on the colonies. In 1775, the Second
Continental Congress commissioned him as commander-in-chief of the Continental
Army in the American Revolution. In that command, Washington drove the British
out of Boston in 1776, but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when
he lost New York City. After crossing the Delaware River in the middle of
winter, he defeated the British in two battles, retook New Jersey, and restored
momentum to the Patriot cause. Washington's strategy enabled Continental forces
to ultimately defeat the British. Historians laud Washington for the selection
and supervision of his generals, preservation and command of the army,
coordination with the Congress, state governors, and their militia, and
attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington
was sometimes outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies, yet was
always able to avoid significant defeats which would have resulted in the
surrender of his army and the loss of the American Revolution.

After victory had been finalized in 1783, Washington resigned as commander-in-
chief rather than remaining in power, proving his commitment to American
republicanism. Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787,
which devised a new form of federal government for the United States. Washington
was widely admired for his strong leadership qualities and was unanimously
elected president by the Electoral College in the first two national elections.
Following his election as president in 1789, he worked to unify rival factions
in the fledgling nation. He helped pass Alexander Hamilton's programs to satisfy
federal and state debts to establish a permanent seat of government, to
implement an effective tax system, and to create a national bank.

In avoiding war with Great Britain, he guaranteed a decade of peace and
profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition
from the Jeffersonians. He oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed
national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary
Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won wide acceptance among
Americans. Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use
today, such as the cabinet system, the inaugural address, and the title Mr.
President. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition
that lasted until 1940 and was later made law by the 22nd Amendment. He
remained non-partisan, never joining the Federalist Party, although he largely
supported its policies. By 1794, Congress was divided between two parties, that
had stemmed from a political-personal feud between Washington's two
secretaries, Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Washington's Farewell Address was
an influential primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship,
sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.

He retired from the presidency in 1797, returning to his home and beloved
plantation at Mount Vernon. Upon his death, Washington was eulogized as "first
in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen". He was
revered in life and in death; scholarly and public polling consistently ranks
him among the top three presidents in American history. He has been depicted and
remembered in monuments, public works, currency, and other dedications to the
present day.

'World War I' (often abbreviated to 'WWI' or 'WW1'), also known as the 'First
World War', the 'Great War', or the 'War to End All Wars', was a global war
originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More
than 70&nbsp;million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were
mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants
and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims
of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents'
technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused
by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history
and precipitated major political change, including the Revolutions of 1917–1923
in many of the nations involved. Unresolved rivalries at the end of the conflict
contributed to the start of the Second World War twenty-one years later.

The war drew in all the world's economic great powers, assembled in two opposing
alliances: the Allies (based on the Triple Entente of the Russian Empire, the
French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland)
versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Although Italy was a
member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary, it did not
join the Central Powers, as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive against the
terms of the alliance. These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more
nations entered the war: Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies,
while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers.

The trigger for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of
Austria, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo
Princip in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-
Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia and, as a result, entangled-international-
alliances, formed over the previous decades, were invoked. Within weeks the
major powers were at war, and the conflict soon spread around the world.

Russia was the first to order a partial mobilisation of its armies on 24–25
July, and when on 28 July Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, Russia
declared general mobilisation on 30 July. Germany presented an ultimatum to
Russia to demobilise, and when this was refused, declared war on Russia on 1
August. Being outnumbered on the Eastern Front, Russia urged its Triple Entente
ally France to open up a second front in the west.

Japan entered the war on the side of the Allies on 23 August 1914, seizing the
opportunity of Germany's distraction with the European War to expand its sphere
of influence in China and the Pacific.

Over forty years earlier in 1870, the Franco-Prussian War had ended the Second
French Empire and France had ceded the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to a unified
Germany. Bitterness over that defeat and the determination to retake Alsace-
Lorraine made the acceptance of Russia's plea for help an easy choice, so France
began full mobilisation on 1 August and, on 3 August, Germany declared war on
France. The border between France and Germany was heavily fortified on both
sides so, according to the Schlieffen Plan, Germany then invaded neutral Belgium
and Luxembourg before moving towards France from the north, leading the United
Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 4 August due to their violation of Belgian
neutrality.

After the German march on Paris was halted in the Battle of the Marne, what
became known as the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition, with a
trench line that changed little until 1917. On the Eastern Front, the Russian
army led a successful campaign against the Austro-Hungarians, but the Germans
stopped its invasion of East Prussia in the battles of Tannenberg and the
Masurian Lakes. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers,
opening fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and the Sinai Peninsula. In 1915,
Italy joined the Allies and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers. Romania joined
the Allies in 1916. After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by German
submarines, and the revelation that the Germans were trying to get Mexico to
make war on the United States, the US declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917.

The Russian government collapsed in March 1917 with the February Revolution, and
the October Revolution followed by a further military defeat brought the
Russians to terms with the Central Powers via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which
granted the Germans a significant victory. After the stunning German Spring
Offensive along the Western Front in the spring of 1918, the Allies rallied and
drove back the Germans in the successful Hundred Days Offensive. On 4 November
1918, the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to the Armistice of Villa Giusti, and
Germany, which had its own trouble with revolutionaries, agreed to an armistice
on 11 November 1918, ending the war in victory for the Allies.

By the end of the war or soon after, the German Empire, Russian Empire, Austro-
Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist. National borders were
redrawn, with nine independent nations restored or created, and Germany's
colonies were parcelled out among the victors. During the Paris Peace Conference
of 1919, the Big Four powers (Britain, France, the United States and Italy)
imposed their terms in a series of treaties. The League of Nations was formed
with the aim of preventing any repetition of such a conflict. This effort
failed, and economic depression, renewed nationalism, weakened successor states,
and feelings of humiliation (particularly in Germany) eventually contributed to
the start of World War II.

The 'Normandy landings' were the landing operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 of
the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II.
Codenamed 'Operation Neptune' and often referred to as '[[D-Day (military term)|D-
Day]]', it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the
liberation of German-occupied northwestern Europe from Nazi control, and laid
the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.

Planning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the
invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed
Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the
main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal and the operation
had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of
at least two weeks as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of
the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days each month
were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in
command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic
Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion.

The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment
and an airborne assault—the landing of 24,000 American, British, and Canadian
airborne troops shortly after midnight. Allied infantry and armoured divisions
began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The target stretch of the
Normandy coast was divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and
Sword. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions,
particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun
emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with
obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work
of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous. Casualties were heaviest at
Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns
were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold
were disabled, using specialised tanks.

The Allies failed to achieve any of their goals on the first day. Carentan, St.
Lô, and Bayeux remained in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not
captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on
the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June;
however, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded
over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000
to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.

Museums, memorials, and war cemeteries in the area now host many visitors
each year.

The 'Great Depression' was a severe worldwide economic depression that took
place mostly during the 1930s, beginning in the United States. The timing of the
Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and
lasted until the late-1930s.John A. Garraty, The Great Depression (1986) It was
the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.Charles
Duhigg, "Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets", The New York Times,
March 23, 2008. In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an
example of how far the world's economy can decline.Barry Eichengreen, Hall of
Mirrors: The Great Depression, The Great Recession, and the Uses-and Misuses-of
History (2014)

The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock
prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the
stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (known as Black Tuesday). Between 1929
and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%. By
comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the
Great Recession.Roger Lowenstein, "History Repeating," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-hall-of-mirrors-by-barry-eichengreen-
1421192283?autologin=y Wall Street Journal Jan 14, 2015] Some economies started
to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of
the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.Garraty, Great
Depression (1986) ch1

The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor.
Personal income, tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international
trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some
countries rose as high as 33%.

Cities around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy
industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming
communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60%. Facing
plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs, areas dependent on
primary sector industries such as mining and logging suffered the most.Mitchell,

Question: What is a Bicycle?

A 'bicycle', also called a 'cycle' or 'bike', is a human-powered, pedal-driven,
single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the
other. A is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.

Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early
21st century, more than 1 billion have been produced worldwide. These numbers
far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of
individual models produced. They are the principal means of transportation in
many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been
adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness, military and police
applications, courier services, bicycle racing and bicycle stunts.

The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or "safety bicycle", has
changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885. But
many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials
and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized
designs for many types of cycling.

The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of
culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that
eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially
invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-
driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels.Heitmann JA. The Automobile and

Question: What is a Baby?
Raw Results:




An 'infant' (from the Latin word infans, meaning "unable to speak" or
"speechless") is the more formal or specialised synonym for "'baby'", the very
young offspring of a human. The term may also be used to refer to juveniles of
other organisms.

A 'newborn' is, in colloquial use, an infant who is only hours, days, or up to
one month old. In medical contexts, newborn or 'neonate' (from Latin, neonatus,
newborn) refers to an infant in the first 28 days after birth; the term applies
to premature, full term, and postmature infants; before birth, the term "fetus"
is used. The term "infant" is typically applied to young children between one
month and one year of age; however, definitions may vary and may include
children up to two years of age. When a human child learns to walk, the term
"toddler" may be used instead.

In British English, an infant school is for children aged between four and
seven. As a legal term, "infancy" continues from birth until age 18.

A 'pencil' is a writing implement or art medium constructed of a narrow, solid
pigment core inside a protective casing which prevents the core from being
broken and/or from leaving marks on the user’s hand during use.

Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving behind a trail of solid core
material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are distinct
from pens, which instead disperse a trail of liquid or gel ink that stains the
light colour of the paper by absorption.

Most pencil cores are made of graphite mixed with a clay binder which leaves
grey or black marks that can be easily erased. Graphite pencils are used for
both writing and drawing and result in durable markings: though writing is
easily removable with an eraser, it is otherwise resistant to moisture, most
chemicals, ultraviolet radiation, and natural aging. Other types of pencil core
are less widely used, such as charcoal pencils, which are mainly used by artists
for drawing and sketching. Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or
editors to correct submitted texts, but are typically regarded as art supplies,
especially those with waxy core binders that tend to smear on paper instead of
erasing. Grease pencils have a softer, crayon-like waxy core that can leave
marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.

The most common type of pencil casing is of thin wood, usually hexagonal in
section but sometimes cylindrical, permanently bonded to the core. Similar
permanent casings may be constructed of other materials such as plastic or
paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the
working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate
casings which are not permanently bonded to the core. Instead, the casing
supports a separate, mobile piece of pigment core that can be extended or
retracted through the casing tip as needed; these pencil casings can be re-
loaded with a new core (usually graphite) when necessary.

}} A 'car' (or 'automobile') is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight
people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars
came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on
them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German
inventor Karl Benz built his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely
available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible
to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford
Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-
drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe
and other parts of the world.

Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and
controlling a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and
controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex.
Examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems,
and in car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an
internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. This
causes air pollution and also contributes to climate change and global warming.
Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and
natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Electric
cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, began to become
commercially available in 2008.

There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs include acquiring the
vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance,
fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs
to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution,
public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life.
Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.

The benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and
convenience. The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and
wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal
well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from
the . The ability for people to move flexibly from place to place has far-
reaching implications for the nature of societies. It was estimated in 2014 that
the number of cars was over 1.25 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of
1986. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other
newly industrialized countries.

Question: What is a Gimble?
Raw Results:

A 'gimbal' is a pivoted support that allows the rotation of an object about a
single axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal
pivot axes, may be used to allow an object mounted on the innermost gimbal to
remain independent of the rotation of its support (e.g. vertical in the first
animation). For example, on a ship, the gyroscopes, shipboard compasses, stoves,
and even drink holders typically use gimbals to keep them upright with respect
to the horizon despite the ship's pitching and rolling.

The gimbal suspension used for mounting compasses and the like is sometimes
called a 'Cardan suspension' after Italian mathematician and physicist Gerolamo
Cardano (1501–1576) described it in detail. However, Cardano did not invent the
gimbal, nor did he claim to. The device has been known since antiquity, first
described in the 3rd c. BCE by Philo of Byzantium, although some modern authors
support it may not have a single identifiable inventor.Needham, Joseph. (1986).

'Barack Hussein Obama II' (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who
served as the 44th President of the United States from January 20, 2009 to
January 20, 2017. The first African American to assume the presidency, he was
previously the junior United States Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008.
Before that, he served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 until 2004.

Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was
admitted to the Union as the 50th state. Raised largely in Hawaii, Obama also
spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in
Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a
community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School,
where he was the first black president of the [[Harvard Law Review]]. After
graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor and taught
constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004.
Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from
1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national
attention in 2004 with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July
Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November
election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president a year after
his campaign began and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton.
He was elected over Republican John McCain and was inaugurated on January 20,
2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate,
accepting the award with the caveat that he felt there were others "far more
deserving of this honor than I."

During his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills into law.
The main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often
referred to as "Obamacare", shortened as the "Affordable Care Act"), the
Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask,
Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation
Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After a
lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and
the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop
levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New
START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered
military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi; Gaddafi was
killed by NATO-assisted forces, and he also ordered the military operation that
resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.

After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama
was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted
inclusiveness for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged
the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional
([[United States v. Windsor]] and [[Obergefell v. Hodges]]). Obama advocated
for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and
issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and
immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in
response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued
the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted
discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change,
initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again
after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a
nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama left
office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating and currently resides in
Washington, D.C. Since leaving office, his presidency has been favorably ranked
by historians and the general public.

'The Beatles' were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With
members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they
became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band. Rooted
in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with
several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to
psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and
unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous
popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania"; as the group's music grew in
sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were
integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of
the counterculture of the 1960s.

The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a
three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass
player. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958,
went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr
to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional
act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly
expanding the group's popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit,
"Love Me Do", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname "the Fab Four" as
Beatlemania grew in Britain over the next year, and by early 1964 became
international stars, leading the "British Invasion" of the United States pop
market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced increasingly innovative
recordings, including the albums [[Rubber Soul]] (1965), [[Revolver (Beatles
album)|Revolver]] (1966), [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] (1967),
[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]] (also known as the White Album, 1968) and
[[Abbey Road]] (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed success
as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died
of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.

The Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over
800 million physical and digital albums worldwide. They have had more number-one
albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act.
They are also the best-selling music artists in the United States, with 178
million certified units. In 2008, the group topped [[Billboard
(magazine)|Billboard]] magazine's list of the all-time most successful artists;
, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with
twenty. They have received seven Grammy Awards, an Academy Award for Best
Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. The group was inducted into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted
individually from 1994 to 2015. They were also collectively included in [[Time

'George Washington' (February 22, 1732}}&nbsp;– , 1799) was an American
statesman and soldier who served as the first President of the United States
from 1789 to 1797 and was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He
served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American
Revolutionary War, and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the
United States Constitution. As a driving force behind the nation's establishment
he came to be known as the "father of the country," both during his lifetime and
to this day.

Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family
of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he
inherited. In his youth, he became a senior officer in the colonial militia
during the first stages of the French and Indian War. He gradually grew
indifferent to British rule with its lack of colonial representation in British
Parliament and excessive taxation on the colonies. In 1775, the Second
Continental Congress commissioned him as commander-in-chief of the Continental
Army in the American Revolution. In that command, Washington drove the British
out of Boston in 1776, but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when
he lost New York City. After crossing the Delaware River in the middle of
winter, he defeated the British in two battles, retook New Jersey, and restored
momentum to the Patriot cause. Washington's strategy enabled Continental forces
to ultimately defeat the British. Historians laud Washington for the selection
and supervision of his generals, preservation and command of the army,
coordination with the Congress, state governors, and their militia, and
attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington
was sometimes outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies, yet was
always able to avoid significant defeats which would have resulted in the
surrender of his army and the loss of the American Revolution.

After victory had been finalized in 1783, Washington resigned as commander-in-
chief rather than remaining in power, proving his commitment to American
republicanism. Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787,
which devised a new form of federal government for the United States. Washington
was widely admired for his strong leadership qualities and was unanimously
elected president by the Electoral College in the first two national elections.
Following his election as president in 1789, he worked to unify rival factions
in the fledgling nation. He helped pass Alexander Hamilton's programs to satisfy
federal and state debts to establish a permanent seat of government, to
implement an effective tax system, and to create a national bank.

In avoiding war with Great Britain, he guaranteed a decade of peace and
profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition
from the Jeffersonians. He oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed
national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary
Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won wide acceptance among
Americans. Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use
today, such as the cabinet system, the inaugural address, and the title Mr.
President. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition
that lasted until 1940 and was later made law by the 22nd Amendment. He
remained non-partisan, never joining the Federalist Party, although he largely
supported its policies. By 1794, Congress was divided between two parties, that
had stemmed from a political-personal feud between Washington's two
secretaries, Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Washington's Farewell Address was
an influential primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship,
sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.

He retired from the presidency in 1797, returning to his home and beloved
plantation at Mount Vernon. Upon his death, Washington was eulogized as "first
in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen". He was
revered in life and in death; scholarly and public polling consistently ranks
him among the top three presidents in American history. He has been depicted and
remembered in monuments, public works, currency, and other dedications to the
present day.

'Richmond' ( ) is the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United
States. It is the center of the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and
the Greater Richmond Region. It was incorporated in 1742, and has been an
independent city since 1871.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 204,214; in 2016, the population was
estimated to be 223,170, the fourth-most populous city in Virginia. The Richmond
Metropolitan Area has a population of 1,260,029, the third-most populous metro
in the state.

Richmond is located at the fall line of the James River, west of Williamsburg,
east of Charlottesville, and south of Washington, D.C. Surrounded by Henrico and
Chesterfield counties, the city is located at the intersections of Interstate 95
and Interstate 64, and encircled by Interstate 295 and Virginia State Route 288.
Major suburbs include Midlothian to the southwest, Chesterfield to the south,
Varina to the southeast, Sandston to the east, Glen Allen to the north and west,
Short Pump to the west and Mechanicsville to the northeast.

The site of Richmond had been an important village of the Powhatan Confederacy,
and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown in 1609, and in
1610–1611. The present city of Richmond was founded in 1737. It became the
capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780, replacing Williamsburg.
During the Revolutionary War period, several notable events occurred in the
city, including Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or give me death" speech in
1775 at St. John's Church, and the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious
Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson. During the American Civil War, Richmond
served as the second and permanent capital of the Confederate States of America.
The city entered the 20th century with one of the world's first successful
electric streetcar systems. The Jackson Ward neighborhood is a national hub of
African-American commerce and culture.

Richmond's economy is primarily driven by law, finance, and government, with
federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as notable legal and
banking firms, located in the downtown area. The city is home to both the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, one of 13 United States courts
of appeals, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, one of 12 Federal Reserve
Banks. Dominion Resources and WestRock, Fortune 500 companies, are headquartered
in the city, with others in the metropolitan area.

'Rome' ( ; ; ) is the capital of Italy and a special comune (named Comune di
Roma Capitale). Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region. With
2,873,874 residents in , it is also the country's most populated comune. It is
the fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city
limits. It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a
population of 4.3 million residents. Rome is located in the central-western
portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the
Tiber. The Vatican City is an independent country inside the city boundaries of
Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome
has been often defined as capital of two states.

Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of
Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it
one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe.Heiken, G., Funiciello,
R. and De Rita, D. (2005), The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the
Eternal City. Princeton University Press. The city's early population originated
from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively
became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman
Empire, and is regarded as the birthplace of Western civilisation and by some as
the first ever metropolis. It was first called The Eternal City (; ) by the
Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up
by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.Stephanie Malia Hom, "Consuming the View: Tourism,
Rome, and the Topos of the Eternal City", Annali d'Igtalianistica '28':91–116
Rome is also called the "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World).

After the fall of the Western Empire, which marked the beginning of the Middle
Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, which had
settled in the city since the 1st century AD, until in the 8th century it became
the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870.

Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all the popes since Nicholas V
(1447–1455) pursued over four hundred years a coherent architectural and urban
programme aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the
world. In this way, Rome became first one of the major centres of the Italian
Renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the Baroque style and
Neoclassicism. Famous artists, painters, sculptors and architects made Rome the
centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. In 1871
Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which in 1946 became the
Italian Republic.

Rome has the status of a global city. In 2016, Rome ranked as the 14th-most-
visited city in the world, 3rd most visited in the European Union, and the most
popular tourist attraction in Italy. Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as
a World Heritage Site. Monuments and museums such as the Vatican Museums and the
Colosseum are among the world's most visited tourist destinations with both
locations receiving millions of tourists a year, and the city hosted the 1960
Summer Olympics. Rome is the seat of several specialized agencies of the United
Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food
Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
The city hosts the headquarters of many international business companies, such
as Eni, Enel, TIM and national and international banks such as Unicredit and
BNL. Its business district, called EUR, is the base of many companies involved
in the oil industry, the pharmaceutical industry and financial services. Rome is
also an important fashion and design centre thanks to renowned international
brands centered in the city. Rome's Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many
Academy Award–winning movies.

'Dallas' () is a city in the U.S. state of Texas. It is the most populous city
in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, which is the fourth most populous
metropolitan area in the United States. The city's population ranks ninth in the
U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence
arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton
industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city
is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the
city are in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the
2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United
States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,317,929
as of July 1, 2016.

Dallas is one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States. From 2010 to
2016, Dallas recorded the highest net domestic migration in the country, in
excess of 300,000. Overall, the Dallas–Fort Worth metro area had the second
largest population increase among metro areas in the U.S., which recorded a
population of 7,233,323 as of July 1, 2016, an increase of 807,000 people since
the 2010 census. Located in North Texas, Dallas is the main core of the largest
metropolitan area in the South and the largest inland metropolitan area in the
United States that lacks any navigable link to the sea.: In ascending order from
the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex (in terms of metropolitan population): Chicago
via Lake Michigan, Los Angeles via the Pacific Ocean, and New York City via the
Atlantic Ocean. For attempts to render the Trinity River navigable to the Gulf

See also Trinity River (Texas). Dallas and nearby Fort Worth were developed due
to the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to
cotton, cattle, and later oil in North and East Texas. The construction of the
Interstate Highway System reinforced Dallas's prominence as a transportation hub
with four major interstate highways converging in the city, and a fifth
interstate loop around it. Dallas developed as a strong industrial and financial
center, and a major inland port, due to the convergence of major railroad lines,
interstate highways, and the construction of Dallas/Fort Worth International
Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.

'Ghana' (), officially the 'Republic of Ghana', is a unitary presidential
constitutional democracy, located along the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean,
in the subregion of West Africa. Spanning a land mass of , Ghana is bordered by
the Ivory Coast in the west, Burkina Faso in the north, Togo in the east and the
Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean in the south. Ghana means "Warrior King" in
the Soninke language.Jackson, John G. (2001) Introduction to African
Civilizations, Citadel Press, p. 201, .

The first permanent state in the territory of present-day Ghana dates back to
the 11th century. Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries, of
which the most powerful was the Kingdom of Ashanti. Beginning in the 15th
century, numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights, with
the British ultimately establishing control of the coast by the late 19th
century. Following over a century of native resistance, Ghana's current borders
were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast. It became independent
of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957.

Ghana's population of approximately 29 million spans a variety of ethnic,
linguistic and religious groups. Five percent of the population practices
traditional faiths, 67.2% adhere to Christianity and 23.6% are Muslim. Its
diverse geography and ecology ranges from coastal savannahs to tropical
rain forests.

Ghana is a democratic country led by a president who is both head of state and
head of the government. Ghana's growing economic prosperity and democratic
political system have made it a regional power in West Africa. It is a member of
the Non-Aligned Movement, the African Union, the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), Group of 24 (G24) and the Commonwealth of Nations.
